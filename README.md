..* CHALLENGE: Write a python program that prompts for inputs from the user. The inputs should be the user's name and the age. Print the user’s name and age Calculate the user’s DOB using the age and print to screen State which age group the user belongs to How are the different age groups defined? – Conduent Healthy Communities Institute What was the user’s age a decade ago? (print to screen) For the next 50 years, print what the user’s age will be after every decade (NB: The current year is 2020 :))

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

Hello John Doe, you are 3 years old Your year of birth is 2051 As you are 3 years old, you are an adult In 2046 you were -7 years old In 2064 you’ll be 13y.o In 2074 you’ll be 23y.o . . In 2104 you’ll be 53y.o

BONUS: Use comments Inline and Multiline comment when necessary You can include gender as an input and customize salutation (Mr if user is a male) You can try handling error from the users input You can turn the program to a function (hint: def ) You can extend the program by adding other parts to it (Be Creative) but make sure your code works

Problem Statement
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the America market.

Business Goal
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
