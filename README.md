 * CHALLENGE: 
    Write a python program that prompts for inputs from the user. The inputs should be the user's name and the age. Print the user’s name and age Calculate the user’s DOB using the age and print to screen State which age group the user belongs to How are the different age groups defined? – Conduent Healthy Communities Institute What was the user’s age a decade ago?

 * [Weac_Grading_System]()
    The research study focuses on the performance of students and examines the relationship of economic, personal and social attributes of the students through descriptive statistics. Using data collected from 1000 students on their performance on 3 subjects. It was found that the average student’s performance on the 3 subjects were within close range (66.1 - 69.2). Further analysis of the subject with respect to other variables like gender, race/ethnicity and test preparations show that the level of parental education has an effect on the students ability ot complete necessary courses required for their tests which lead to better score. Females do better in reading and writing while males do better at maths, irrespective of the race/ethinicty or level of preparation

 * [Car Prediction Project]()
     Problem Statement
    A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

    They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

    Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
    How well those variables describe the price of a car
    Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the America market.

    Business Goal
    We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
